Consider the following graph:

(A (B D)
 B (A D C)
 C (E B)
 D (A B)
 E (A C D)
)

We start in A.

Find the shortest path to E.

Breadt-first:

  [[A]] one step

  [[A B] [A D]] two steps

  [[A B D] [A B C] [A D B]] three steps

  [[A B C E] [A D B C]] four steps

Stop we have an answer.

This is the shortest answer.

This is not the only answer.
